## Dependency direction

```text
Domain <- Application <- Infrastructure
                    <- Wpf
```

`Wpf` may reference `Infrastructure` only in the composition root.

## Responsibilities

- Domain: books, formats, identities, duplicate groups, findings, scores, recommendations, plans, invariants.
- Application: use cases and integration interfaces.
- Infrastructure: read-only SQLite, paths, hashing, ebook inspection, Calibre CLI, backups, JSON storage, analysis cache.
- WPF: selection, progress, comparison, review, approval, history, and settings.
- WPF tests: focused ViewModel and presentation-state behavior on the Windows target.

## Long-running operations

Must be asynchronous, cancellable, progress-reporting, bounded in parallelism, and non-blocking to the UI.

## EPUB inspection boundary

Application owns the provider-neutral `IEpubInspector` contract, inspection limits/results, deterministic scoring engine, and bounded orchestration. Infrastructure alone owns ZIP, XML, HTML, image-header, filesystem, and VersOne/Html Agility Pack types. EPUB files are preflighted and opened read-only, content is never extracted or fetched, expected untrusted-input failures become structured inspection problems, and the final snapshot is published only after all assessments complete.

## Recommendation and review-export boundary

Domain owns immutable recommendation selections, reasons, warnings, decision strength, qualitative confidence, review values, and invariants. Application indexes completed Milestone 2â€“4 evidence, orchestrates deterministic generation, validates overrides, evaluates staleness, and owns the external export port. Infrastructure alone owns JSON parsing/serialization and guarded file publication outside the selected library. WPF owns session review interaction and file selection; ViewModels call Application use cases and do not write files. Recommendation review artifacts contain no cleanup-plan or mutation instructions.

## Errors

Distinguish validation failures, read failures, missing-file findings, malformed-format findings, operation conflicts, process failures, verification failures, and unexpected faults.

## Security

Validate paths, safely escape process arguments, avoid arbitrary commands, keep content out of logs by default, and require explicit consent before sending content to external AI services.
