# Functional Requirements

## Library analysis

- Select and validate a Calibre library directory.
- Open `metadata.db` read-only.
- Load book IDs, titles, authors, author-sort values, identifiers, series, languages, formats, and managed paths.
- Resolve referenced format files and report missing or anomalous paths.
- Calculate SHA-256 using streaming I/O, cancellation, progress, and bounded concurrency.

## Duplicate detection

Support progressively:

1. byte-identical files;
2. strong identifier matches;
3. exact normalized title/author matches;
4. normalized content fingerprints;
5. fuzzy metadata matches.

Every group must expose confidence and reasons. Exact title/author matches are candidates, not proof of identical content.

## EPUB analysis

Inspect readability, package metadata, identifiers, language, cover, navigation, spine, resources, internal references, text presence, chapter structure, and encryption indicators. Malformed files become findings rather than application crashes.

## PDF analysis

Milestone 9 implements safe read-only PDF assessment for verified PDF formats in
the library snapshot. It reports strict readability, encryption/password
status, page count, bounded metadata, deterministic all-page or sampled-page
text/image evidence, scan-like/digital/mixed classification with confidence,
outline and inert active-content facts, conservative repeated/blank-page
evidence, checksum-valid bounded ISBN evidence, resource-limit outcomes, and a
PDF-specific explainable quality score.

PDF parsing runs in one disposable bounded worker per file. It does not render,
perform OCR, decode images for presentation, extract attachments, execute PDF
actions, follow links, retain complete text, access the network, or mutate the
library. Classification is evidence rather than score, and PDF assessments do
not rank retained PDFs or affect recommendations, cleanup, execution, or
recovery.

Cross-document EPUB/PDF content fingerprints, equality/similarity comparisons,
and any resulting recommendation-policy changes begin in Milestone 10 or later.

## Scoring and recommendations

- Score formats and metadata separately.
- Every rule returns an adjustment and explanation.
- A recommendation can combine metadata and formats from different records.
- Conflicting non-identical files of the same format require review.

## Review workflow

The user can navigate groups, compare records, inspect findings and covers, open files externally, accept or override recommendations, defer groups, and filter by confidence or issue.

## Cleanup plan and execution

Generate an immutable JSON plan containing record IDs, chosen metadata source, chosen format sources, removals, expected hashes, backup requirements, warnings, and approval details.

Execution must revalidate the plan, back up content and metadata, use supported Calibre tooling, capture command output, reload the library, verify results, and retain audit history.

## AI

Optional AI may assist with ambiguous metadata or edition comparison. It must include provenance and may not directly authorize destructive operations.
